        <p>Below is a list of projects that I have worked on:</p>
        <a href="https://billyayiera.github.io/My-First-Project/">Online school Application:</a>
        <p>The website is intended to help people not only easily land schools of their choices but also land great university courses.<br>
        I used the following languages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML</li>

          </ol>
        <br>
        <a href="https://eugeneiregi.github.io/Myfarm/">Farming my Farm:</a>
        <p>Farming my farm is a global platform that will enable farmers working in the urban areas as well as rural to be able to meet their farm expectations as well as their other businesses without necessarily going to their farm to monitor  their farm progress.
